    <h1>HTML TAGS THAT CAN BE USE TO UPLOAD OR ADD MEDIA & FILES TO A WEBSITE</h1>
  </center>
  <br><br>

  <h4>Here are some examples of these kinds of tags:
  </h4>
  <br>

  <ul>
    <h3>IMAGE</h3>
    <li>If you like to add some images to your website. You can use the '< img >' tag. For example: <br>

      <img height="400px" width="400px" src="/assets/img/htmlMeme.jpg" alt="sample_image"><br>

      At first you can't open it in fullscreen if you tried to click it, but if you surround the '< img >' tag in an '< a >' tag you can view <br> it in full screen. Try it again: <br>

      <a href="/assets/img/htmlMeme.jpg">
        <img height="400px" width="400px" src="/assets/img/htmlMeme.jpg" alt="sample_image">
      </a>
    </li><br>

    <h3>AUDIO</h3>
    <li>Next, if you want to add some audio to your webpage. You're going to use the '< audio >' tag and inside the <br> audio tag you have to set the source of the audio you want to play, using the '< source >' tag if you have multiple <br> audio with different file types. Here's an example of an audio:
    <br><br>
    <audio controls>
      <source src="/assets/audio/VÃ˜J, Narvent - Memory Reboot (Music Video).mp3" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>
    <br><br>
    You can also manipulate it by adding 'controls' to control the audio, 'muted' for it to stay muted, and 'loop' to play <br> it over and over again inside the audio tag.
    </li>
    <br>

    <h3>VIDEO</h3>
    <li>
      We can also add some videos by using the '< video >' tag and inside it is setting the source just like what we did when we add an audio. <br>

      <video height="500px" width="500px" controls>
        <source src="/assets/video/Your Name AMV ft. RJ Pasin.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
    </li>
    <br>

    <h3>FILE</h3>
    <li>
      Lastly, we can also add some file by just using the '< a >' and set its path to the file that we want to attatch in our website. Here's an example: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/assets/files/HelloWorld.txt">Sample File</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  </ul>
